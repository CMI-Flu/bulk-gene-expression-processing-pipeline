OVERVIEW

Use this code to gather and integrate data for an ImmPort SDY, from ImmPort,GEO and SRA.
 
This is a new version to run that will automatically download the SDY tab file from ImmPort and then process it.

Most functions can be also done on the local computer, except automated ImmPort download & SRA download.

Various tables from the Tab file are parsed and a dataframe of ImmPort 
 metadata is created, including a field for GSM (GEO sample accession)

From the GSMs, the associated GEO series are determined. 

The user can run different sections based on the type of data and what the desired output is:

For bulk RNA-seq: The general plan is to download the raw data (fastq files). The GEO series are determined and the metadata is merged with the ImmPort metadata. 
  SRA accessions for each sample are determined; expected file names for each sample added to the metadata. A dSQ job array is constructed which will run SRA-Toolkit to download the FASTQ files.
 
For sc Assays: The general plan is to download the raw data (fastq files). The 
  GEO series are determined and the metadata is merged with the ImmPort metadata. 
  SRA accessions for each sample are determined; expected file names for each sample added to the metadata. A dSQ job array is constructed which will run SRA-Toolkit to download the FASTQ files.
  
For micro array assays: The metadata and intensity data is downloaded from GEO. For microarray data, the intensity matrices are more tightly integrated with the GEO record than for bulk; therefore the matrix already has the proper GSM column names, so no renaming is done. A summarized experiment object is created for each GSE associated with the ImmPort ID.
 
# Libraries
To get data from GEO / SRA
GEOquery: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GEOquery.html
GEOfastq: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GEOfastq.html

The column renaming strategy utilizes longest common substring of two strings.
The PTXQC package, designed for proteomics, has a convenient function, LCS, to compute this.

# Pipeline Setup

Specify the following here:
  - SDY ID & data release (DR)
  - ImmPort account credentials
  - Path to ImmPort download script - The ImmPort download script is a separate 
      script provided by ImmPort. It uses Aspera, which is installed on McCleary. 
      Some paths have been changed from the defaults to match McCleary.
  - work directory

```{r echo=FALSE}
# set work directory
# just a global variable since setwd() is not persistent in a notebook
work_dir <- "WORKPATH"
# ImmPort data release version
# If this is out of date looks like a file not found error is raised
DR <- "DR54"
dl_script <- "downloadImmportData.sh"

# Immport Study ID
SDY <- "SDYXXXX"


# ImmPort user name / password
user <- "Username"
pass <- "Password"
```

# Download Tab file for SDY from ImmPort & unzip
NOTE: Automated download requires that the Aspera libraries are installed on your system and that the download script is setup for your system's paths.Can be setup on your local system if it's running linux. Instructions can be found here:  docs.immport.org/filedownload/tool/#
  
  On the local system you can also manually download the tab file (parsed) then proceed ith the rest of this code block.
  
  The ImmPort tab file is a gziped file that contains text data files for each ImmPort table for a given study. The tab file follows a standard namingconvention that includes the SDY ID & data release, which we specified in an earlier chunk.
  
  Once downloaded we unzip it; in the next chunk we extract data from some of the files.

```{r}
# dynamically set tab file name from settings for SDY & data release version
tab_file_name <- paste0("/", SDY, "/", SDY, "-", DR, "_Tab.zip")

# call download script which will get SDY tab file and download to cwd
# set wd
setwd(work_dir)
system(paste(dl_script, user, pass, tab_file_name))

# IF RUNNING ON LOCAL MACHINE, edit the tab_path to reflect where you downloaded
#  the tab.zip file
# path to tab file
tab_path <- paste0(work_dir, tab_file_name)

# unzip to same dir
ext_path <- paste0(work_dir, "/", SDY)

unzip(tab_path, exdir = ext_path)
```

# Process the ImmPort Study
This chunck calls a function that parses the study metadata from several files into a single dataframe

```{r}
# construct path to unzipped dir
pth <- paste0(ext_path, "/", SDY, "-", DR, "_Tab")

# set output path
out_path <- path(pth, "output")
  
# get name of sdy Tab file from pth, for use later
sdy_file_name <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(path_file(pth))
sdy_id <-str_match(sdy_file_name, "SDY\\d+")[1]
  
# call function to process study
sdy_df <- process_sdy(pth)
df_pth <- paste0(ext_path, '/', sdy_id, '_df.csv')
write.csv(sdy_df,df_pth)

```

# Get the GSEs
ImmPort does not store the GSE IDs; each sample has a GSM.
So we collect the GSMs and generate a list of unique GSE's that contain them.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# get all gsm's from df
gsm_list <- sdy_df$REPOSITORY_ACCESSION

# apparently some SDYs have SRA entries as well, so we need to check &
#  filter to just those that start with"GSM"
gsm_list <- gsm_list[grepl("^GSM",gsm_list)]
  
# call function to get unique GSE values from list
# an SDY could have gsms in > 1 gse
gse_list <- list_gse(gsm_list)
print(gse_list)
```

# Check GSE list.
Remove GSE's that are super-series.
Super series list all of the samples of the sub-series, so I think there is potential for duplication here. Let's try to filter out super-series by examining the relation attribute, found at:
experimentData(g[[i]])@other$relation

Print the overall design field, to see if series is single-cell, bulk or array

```{r echo=FALSE}
# new list of gse's to process
gse_list_proc <- list()

for (g in gse_list){
  # get metadata for each GEO series
  #print(g)
  gse <- getGEO(g)
  
  # check the relation attribute for the first item in g; if relation has
  #  pattern indicating it's a superseries, skip
  # it could be null so check that first
  if(is.null(experimentData(gse[[1]])@other$relation)){
    # if null then can't be a superseries (hopefully)
    gse_list_proc <- append(gse_list_proc, g)
    print(experimentData(gse[[1]])@other$overall_design)
  }else{
    if(grepl("^SuperSeries of:", experimentData(gse[[1]])@other$relation)){
      # skip to next loop item
      next
    }else{
      gse_list_proc <- append(gse_list_proc, g)
      # check the 'overall_design' attribute for the first item in g;
      print(experimentData(gse[[1]])@other$overall_design)
    }
  }
}
print(gse_list_proc)
```


# Get SRA accessions
This section is needed if raw data will be downloaded from SRA.
Any actual download will be performed by a separate job array script, but we need to assign the file names now. Since the raw data file names are based onthe SRA accessions, we can infer them from the accessions and the number of reads (1 for SE, 2 for PE, etc)
The file names are added to the SDY / GEO metadata so they can be linked by the user later.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# loop the gse's in gse_list_proc
# treat the first item differently from the rest (merge vs update)
for(j in 1:length(gse_list_proc)){
  # get metadata for each GEO series
  gse <- getGEO(gse_list_proc[j])
  # in this context, getGEO returns a list, since you can get data 
  #  from >1 platform

  # empty vectors to hold title, description & platform metadata fields 
  #  for series
  gsm_v <- vector(mode="character")
  title_v <- vector(mode="character")
  description_v <- vector(mode="character")
  platform_v <- vector(mode = "character")
  
  # loop platforms in gse, add to title, description & platform vectors
  # The title & description will be used to match the submitted colnames
  #  to the corresponding GSM, to align with the ImmPort metadata
  # The platform will be added to the ImmPort metadata.
  for (i in 1:length(gse)){
    gsm_v <- c(gsm_v, pData(gse[[i]])$geo_accession)

          rep(NA, max_ln - length(description_v))), 
          title = c(title_v, rep(NA, max_ln - length(title_v))),
          platform_id = platform_v)
  
  # update ImmPort_meta with description, title & platform, 
  #  by merging or updating with pData_df

# Write ImmPort data to file

# Download the raw data from SRA
In the previous chunk we added the FASTQ file names to the SDY dataframe. Herewe build (and submit) a job array to run on McCleary. Each job downloads the raw data for a given SRA accession and gzips them. This is done using commands from SRA toolkit.

Once the job array is submitted, this chunk is done. The user can monitor the rogress of the jobs directly on McCleary.

Ma y need to be modified based on the hpc system.

```{r}
# set working dir to sub-dir of where SDY is saved
out_dir <- dir_create(path(out_path,"fastq"))
# setwd(paste0(work_dir, "/", SDY))
setwd(out_dir)

# create & save dSQ job script file
# At this point the SDY DF has the fastq file names, revert fastq_1 back to SRR
#  by removing the "_1"
srr_v <- str_replace(sdy_df$R1_file, "_1", "")

# df for commands
dsq_df <- data.frame(srr = srr_v)
dsq_df$sra_cmd <- paste0("module load SRA-Toolkit; prefetch ", 
                         dsq_df$srr, "; ", "fasterq-dump --split-files ",
                         dsq_df$srr, "; gzip ", dsq_df$srr, "_*")

# rm srr col
dsq_df <- dsq_df %>% select(!srr)

# write df of commands to wd
write.table(dsq_df, file = "array_job_list.txt", row.names = F, col.names = F, quote = F)

# cmd to submit the job list
#job_submit <- "/vast/palmer/apps/avx2/software/dSQ/1.05/dsq --job-file array_job_list.txt  -c 6 --mem-per-cpu 4g --mail-type ALL -o dsq-jobfile-%A_%a-%N.out -t 4:00:00 --submit"

# run the job array
#system(job_submit)
